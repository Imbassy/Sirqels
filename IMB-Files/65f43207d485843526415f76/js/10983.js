       "@type": "Answer",
       "text": "There are basic (non-CMS) and CMS Site Plans and eCommerce plans. Site Plans are essential for every website that you publish using a custom domain name - note that every one of your websites will require you to subscribe to a separate plan. Workspace plans don’t let you publish your website. To publish a website on your own domain, you will need a Site plan for every website or online store you want to publish on the Internet."

     "name": "How does Webflow hosting work:",
     "acceptedAnswer": {
       "@type": "Answer",
       "text": "Webflow offers two primary hosting options: the Webflow Enterprise plan and the professional hosting plan. Both these options are managed directly by Webflow, ensuring reliability and performance. If you opt to host the site on your own servers, you can do so, but there’s a catch: you’ll lose the benefits of Webflow’s CMS capabilities. For those who prioritize data residency or need to adhere to specific regional compliance regulations, there’s good news. With the Webflow Enterprise Hosting Plan, there’s a solution to host the site locally in your preferred country or servers. However, this flexibility is exclusive to the Enterprise."
